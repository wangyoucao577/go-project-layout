# Go Project Layout
This is my understanding of how to structure `Go` project layout.

  - It's just an organization name "golang-standards" used by some one to manage these repos. It's harmful if you really think it's a standard and try to always follow it.     
  - On the other hand, I think this repo still have some benifits: collects many resources for the "golang-project-layout" question, gives suggestion for how to do it, etc.     
  - Try to read it as a post, think about what's valueable for you.
